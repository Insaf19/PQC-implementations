This directory include all the KAT files for our implementations of Lepton.CPA and Lepton.CCA under the choices of all the eight parameter sets. Specifically, the KAT directory contains two sub directories Lepton.CPA and Lepton.CCA, which in turn contains eight sub directories Light I to II, Moderate I to Moderate IV, Paranoid I to II, to accommodate the corresponding KAT files. For example, the KAT files under directory \KAT\Lepton.CPA\Light_I correspond to Lepton.CPA with security strength Light I.
