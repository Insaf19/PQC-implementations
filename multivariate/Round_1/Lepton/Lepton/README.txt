This main directory includes the following sub-directories:
1. KAT
2. Optimized_Implementation
3. Reference_Implementation
4. Supporting_Documentation

where KAT contains all the Known Answer Tests files, Supporting_Documentation contains all the supporting documentations, Reference_Implementation and Optimized_Implementation include the basic and optimized implementation of the crypto-system written in ANSI C. 

As our basic reference implementation with source code written in ANSI C already provides quite desirable performance and also due to the lack of specialized skills in deep optimizations, we use the same source code for Reference_Implementation and Optimized_Implementation.

Supporting_Documentation includes cover page, algorithm specification, and other aspects of the crypto-systems, such as security, correctness, implementations and signed agreements (hard copies are yet to be handed over to NIST during the first PQC standardization conference) by the submitters and owners of the algorithms and their implementations.
