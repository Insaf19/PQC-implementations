RVB Algorithm

Reference_Implementation:

Contains the ANSI C reference implementation. A standard makefile is 
located in the project direcory. When using the makefile, object 
files and the executable are stored in the project directory.


Optimized_Implementation:

Is identical with the reference implementation.
If the symbol MULTITHREADED_MATRIX_MULTIPLICATION_ENABLED is defined,
OpenMP is used to speed up the matrix multiplication. This symbol is
NOT defined by default.
When OpenMP is enabled, the code is only faster than the reference implementation
at the "strengths" 200 and 300 decimal digits!


System requirements:

Intel x64 microprocessor, Linux, 64 bit, GCC compiler (NIST PQC Reference Platform) 


Required libraries:

GMP (The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library): https://gmplib.org/
MPFR (The GNU MPFR Library): http://www.mpfr.org/
openSSL

Installation of GMP:
Ubuntu/Debian: e.g. by using the command line
 sudo apt-get install libgmp3-dev
or through the "Packeages GUI" by searching for libgmp3-dev

Installation of MPFR:
http://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-current/mpfr.html#Installing-MPFR

MPFR-3.1.6 can be found in the mpfr directory. cd to this directory,
then type the following commands:
 ./configure
 make
 make install


Installation of openSSL:
 sudo apt-get install libssl-dev


KAT:

Test Parameters generated by PQCgenKAT_kem program provided by NIST
