In this optical media you can find the following folders:
- KAT
- Python Implementation (Optional)
- Optimized implementation
- Referece_implementation
- Supporting documentation

As wroten in technical documentation, we are proposing 4 profiles for the crypto-system:
Profile 1: 8-bits Platform  - d=16  provide 64 bits key lenght.
Profile 2: 16-bits Platform - d=32  provide 128 bits key lenght.
Profile 3: 32-bits Platform - d=64  provide 256 bits key lenght.
Profile 4: 64-bits Platform - d=128 provide 128 bits key lenght (optional).
For the last one no KAT files or implementation in ansi C code is provided. Just a draft is present
in the Python implementation (optional).


1.- KAT:
    ----
KAT: Known Answer Test.
Files generated according your specifications. For each profile a pair of files ".req" and ".rsp" is included:
- PQCkemKAT_336.req:   8bits version request  KAT file
- PQCkemKAT_336.rsp:   8bits version response KAT file
- PQCkemKAT_592.req:  16bits version request  KAT file
- PQCkemKAT_592.rsp:  16bits version response KAT file
- PQCkemKAT_1104.req: 32bits version request  KAT file
- PQCkemKAT_1104.rsp: 32bits version response KAT file

Intermediate values:
- PQCkemKATWithIntermediateValues_8.rsp:   8bits version response  KAT file with intermediate values
- PQCkemKATWithIntermediateValues_16.rsp: 16bits version response  KAT file with intermediate values
- PQCkemKATWithIntermediateValues_32.rsp: 32bits version response  KAT file with intermediate values

Also a folder "Examples with intermediate values" is included. This folder contains the following txt files:
HK17-64bitsKeys.txt  file for Profile 1
HK17-128bitsKeys.txt file for Profile 2
HK17-256bitsKeys.txt file for Profile 3
HK17-512bitsKeys.txt file for Profile 4
Each file contains a header and 100 lines of values separated by ";".
Fields:
HK17: Name of the algorithm
test nb: Number of test
Test Description: A description of the test
degree: Degree of the polynomial.
oa: First Octonion oa (public)
ob: Second Octonion ob (public)
m: one secret power of Alice
n: second secret power of Alice
r: one secret power of Bob
s: second secret power of Bob
rA: Token generated by Alice (intermediate result)
rB: Token generated by Bob (intermediate result)
k1: Alice's Key
k2: Bob's Key


2. Python implementation (Optional):
   ---------------------------------
2.1. About the main program: HK17-O.py
     --------------------------------- 
As this is not required, this is just a monolytic, not optimized program: a draft.
It uses the following Libraries: "Random", "Datetime", and "Octonions"
In the technical documentation and in Statement 2.b.4. we are defining 4 different profiles 
classified by expected post-quantum security:
Profile 1: 08-bits Platform - degree of polynomials d=16  - security classification: AES-32bits
Profile 2: 16-bits Platform - degree of polynomials d=32  - security classification: AES-64bits
Profile 3: 32-bits Platform - degree of polynomials d=64  - security classification: AES-128bits
Profile 4: 64-bits Platform - degree of polynomials d=128 - security classification: AES-256bits
Profiles can be selected by uncommenting the corresponding modulo (lines 17-20)
Program can show you execution times per "n" keys generated. n-value can be set on line: 
After execution, keys can be shown by typing "k1" (Key Alice) or "k2" (Key Bob). 
Messages (error or not) can be shown by typing "message".
Execution times and number of key generated can be shown by typing "times"
2.2. Libraries:
     ----------
Random: Generate the random numbers needed in order to initialize elements.
Datetime: Used for computing execution times.
Octonions: It's a library created containing the operations with octonions: summ, product, scale,
power, polynomial generation, computing the value of a polynomial of a specific octonion.
