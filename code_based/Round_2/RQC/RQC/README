This archive is a proposal in response to NIST's call for proposal for standar-
dization of quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms.

RQC provides POST-QUANTUM CODE-BASED PUBLIC KEY ENCRYPTION and targets NIST's 
security levels 1, 3, and 5.

This archive is organized as follows:

- KATs: Known Answer Test values and verbose outputs for each parameter set
- Reference_Implementation: Implementation of each parameter set
- Optimized_Implementation: Copy of Reference_Implementation
- Supporting_Documentation: Supporting documentation and tweaks for round 2
