This archive is a proposal in response to NIST's call for proposal for standar-
dization of quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms.

ROLLO is a compilation of three candidates to the NIST's competition for
post-quantum cryptography standardization. They are based on rank metric codes
and they all share the same decoding algorithm for LRPC codes. Rank-Ouroboros
(formely known as Ouroboros-R) and LAKE are IND-CPA KEM running in the category
"post-quantum key exchange". LOCKER is an IND-CCA2 PKE running in the category
"post-quantum public key encryption". Different sets of parameters for these
three cryptosystems are proposed for security strength categories 1, 3 and 5.

===============================================================================

This archive is organized as follows:

- KATs : Known Answer Test values and verbose outputs for each parameter set
- Reference_Implementation : Implementation of each parameter set
- Optimized_Implementation : Copy of Reference_Implementation
- Supporting_Documentation : Supporting documentation for ROLLO and tweaks for the second round

The authors did their best to make this archive complete and proper.
