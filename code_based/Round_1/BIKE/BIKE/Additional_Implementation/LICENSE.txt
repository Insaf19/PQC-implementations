* Additional implementation of "BIKE: Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation". 
* This package is an "additional optimized" implementation of BIKE1 and BIKE2, 
* of the BIKE submission to csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography.

* The package offers AVX2 and AVX512 implementations, and can be compiled with/without 
* constant time components. 
* The optimizations are based on the description developed in the paper: 
* N. Drucker, S. Gueron, 
* "A toolbox for software optimization of QC-MDPC code-based cryptosystems", 
* ePrint (2017).
* The decoder (in decoder/decoder.c) algorithm is the algorithm included in
* the early submission of CAKE (due to N. Sandrier and R Misoczki).
